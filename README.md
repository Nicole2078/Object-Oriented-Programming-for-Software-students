**Personal Bio:** I'm a single mom of one child, that needed to start my life over and school is part of getting myself on track and to take care of myself and my daughter. I want to show my daughter how to achieve goals no matter where you are at in life. I have a High-school diploma. Southwest Tech is the first college that I've attendend. I have an older brother, that I love and admire, he does coding for a living and has taught Linux in the airfoce for many years. He is a big reason I want to explore this field of education and soon to be a career. I'm exploring software development and enjoying it, but I also want to explore the field of cyber security.

Taking this course was a way for me to get into school, which I had not done in over 15 years. I want to learn and understand the world of software devempment and computer languages. I feel it will open a lot of directions I can choose to go. Right now I have my sights on cyber security.
